# ImageGalleryHandling
A small toolbox of PowerShell scripts to clean up large photo/video libraries on Windows. It covers the whole flow: find exact duplicates, detect visually identical images, organize files by capture date, and safely move duplicates out of the way â€” all with dry-run support, logs, and robust error handling.
